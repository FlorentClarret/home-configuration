# Home configuration

This project contains my personal home configuration files including aliases, git, vim, mc and others.

# Requirements

The software used and configured in this repo are the following:

# vim
# screen
# git
# most
# midnight commander (a.k.a. mc)
# glances
# intellij idea
# less

# Usage

In order to deploy my configuration, simply run:

``` bash 
[0][2019-02-28 09:15:26][0][florentclarret@dana:~/Documents/Dev/Shell/home-configuration] (branch: master)  
 $ ./install_home_configuration.bash 
```

If you want the aliases and variables to be loaded automatically, add this to your .bashrc (or .profile, or whatever you are using) :

``` bash
source ~/.aliases/load.sh
```

# Remove my configuration
